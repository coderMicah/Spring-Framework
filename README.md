# Dependency Injection Example

This project is an example of how to use dependency injection in Java using the Spring Framework. The project uses both XML-based  configuration for dependency injection and also demonstrates the use of the **@Autowired** annotation.

## What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows objects to be created with their dependencies supplied from an external source. This makes it easier to test and maintain code because dependencies can be swapped out without changing the code.

## XML-based vs Annotation-based Configuration

XML-based configuration involves defining beans and their dependencies in an XML file. Annotation-based configuration involves using annotations such as **@Component**, **@Service**, and **@Autowired** to define beans and their dependencies.

## @Autowired Annotation

The **@Autowired** annotation is used to inject dependencies into a bean. It can be used on fields, constructors, or methods.
